  ## Set the async context timeout to 60-seconds.

  ## Adjust the size of the request and response thread pools to 100
  ## by default.  This means, in theory, 100*2 total threads will be
  ## managed by an internal pool within Curacao to deal with requests
  ## and responses into the application.

  ## Override the default request charset, setting it to UTF-8.
