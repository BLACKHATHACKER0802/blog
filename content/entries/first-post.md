## First Post Ever

Oh hai first post ever.

### Testing this out

Does this work?

@{hash}

@{title}

@{date}

### Code

Here's some scala code:

```scala
private[this] val x = "foobar"
```

Here's some JavaScript:

```javascript
// Comments
(function(w) {
  var x = "baz";
  w.title = x;
}(window));
```

Looks syntactically valid.
