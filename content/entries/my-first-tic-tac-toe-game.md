Every once in a while I'll dig into my code archive and stumble across a total gem.  This morning I rediscovered a very primitive tic-tac-toe game I wrote in 2001.  In fact, I explicitly remember writing this game one Saturday afternoon and thinking to myself how amazing and awesome it was.  I've since moved on to bigger and better things, but I always enjoy a trip down memory lane.  I wrote this game in Borland C++ on an old 200MHz Pentium II HP Vectra with about 128 MB of RAM.  I still have the [binary executable](static/entries/my-first-tic-tac-toe-game/tic-tac-toe.zip) and tried to fire it up on Windows Vista.  Surprisingly, it still works!

Oh, and [here's the source](static/entries/my-first-tic-tac-toe-game/tic-tac-toe-everything.zip) as if anyone cares.
