## About Mark

Hey, I'm Mark.

Born and raised in Silicon Valley, I'm currently a full-stack Software Engineer at [Apple](http://www.apple.com) in California.

Although I can't formally discuss what I do at Apple, I can say that I build robust and scalable user facing "stuff" and the web-services that back them.  A self-proclaimed expert in a number of technical disciplines, my programming languages of choice include Java, Scala, Clojure, PHP, and of course, JavaScript.

When not at Apple, I'm a part-time software engineering consultant that builds and maintains web applications and services for non-profits. I'm an avid Open-Source software user and contributor, as evident by my [GitHub commit history](https://github.com/markkolich).  I use Mac OS X and Linux exclusively, enjoy biking to work, and love building wonderful, simple, and elegant software.

As far as learnin' goes, I hold a B.S. in Computer Science from [Loyola Marymount University](http://www.lmu.edu) in Los Angeles.

And lastly, any opinions expressed on this site are mine, and under no circumstances represent those of my employer.
